# Squad Tools - Resources For The Squad Community!
  - The entire code behind the website https://squadtools.tempusowl.com
  - It's a website to educate/spread info to the Squad Community. 
  - Info about the game Squad can be found on https://joinsquad.com/ 

## Why was this website created?
I originally started creating guides for the Squad community, most notably my ~40 page SL guide. I wanted somewhere to host it, thus I made a basic website. In creating that guide and I verified all data I put in it, and in that I found several prominent guides/resources were incorrect about ammo racking/armor combat. I found many incorrect opinions spread through the community person to person. Like shooting turret ring is the fastest way to kill the tank with sabot, while maybe a few years ago it was it is no longer the case. I wanted to put out the facts all in once place, and correct some of the varying opinions that exist in the squad community. Now, my goal with squad tools is to bridge the gap between fact/stats and strategy. I want squad tools to be a resource to help both new and veteran players, alike, to learn from.

This project is not monetized in any way.

## How can I contribute? 
  - For factual infomation, like vehicle stats/images/factions. I have uploaded all the source files to google drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NyRLPqD4B9n1sKOxqRKlll2oQ61wI5wo?usp=sharing . You will need Photoshop to open/edit them.
  - For guide contributions, dicuss things within an issue rather than create pulls. If people start making/editing guides it gets rather complicated on what too include, or not. I may add a section for community guides in the future, though that is not priority for now.
