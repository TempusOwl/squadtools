# Squad Tools - Resource For The JoinSquad.com Community!
  The code behind the website https://squadtools.tempusowl.com
  It's a website to educate/spread info to the Squad Community. Info about the game Squad can be found on https://joinsquad.com/ 

## Why was this website created?
I originally started creating guides for the Squad community, notably my ~40 page SL guide. I wanted somewhere to host it, thus I made a basic website. In creating that guide I verified all data I put in it, and in that I found several prominent guides/resources were incorrect about ammo rack positions on enemy armor. I sought to verify and dive deeper beyond what the squad wiki or others have sought to do. My goal with squad tools is to bridge the gap between fact/stats and strategy. I wanted squad tools to be a resource to help new players learn from, not just look at. While being a resource for veteran players to min-max their decision-making. It devolved into becoming quite the beast, with many custom infographics I hope will be useful to the Squad community! 

This project is not monetized in any way.


## How can I contribute? 
  - For factual infomation, like vehicle stats/images/factions. I have uploaded all the source files to google drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NyRLPqD4B9n1sKOxqRKlll2oQ61wI5wo?usp=sharing . You will need Photoshop to open/edit them.
  - For guide contributions, dicuss things within an issue rather than create pulls. If people start making/editing guides it gets rather complicated on what too include, or not. I may add a section for community guides in the future, though that is not priority for now.
