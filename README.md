## Why was this website created?
I originally started creating guides for the Squad community, most notably my ~40 page SL guide. I wanted somewhere to host it, thus I made a basic website. In creating that guide I verified all data I put in it, and I found several prominent guides/resources were incorrect about ammo racking/armor combat. This lead me to wanting to put all the corrected facts all in once place. The site become much larger focus, and now my goal with squad tools is to bridge the gap between facts/stats and strategy. I want SquadTools to be a resource to help both new and veteran players, alike to learn from.

This project is not monetized in any way.

## How can I contribute? 
  - For factual infomation, like vehicle stats/images/factions. I have uploaded all the source files to google drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NyRLPqD4B9n1sKOxqRKlll2oQ61wI5wo?usp=sharing . You will need Photoshop to open/edit them.
  - For guide contributions, dicuss things within an issue rather than create pulls. If people start making/editing guides it gets rather complicated on what too include, or not. I may add a section for community guides in the future, though that is not priority for now.
  - Anyone can also just open an issue on github, and I will do my best to fix the issue.
